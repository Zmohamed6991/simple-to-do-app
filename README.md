Project Title: To Do App

Description: A simple Todo App built with React where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. 

Technologies Used: React, React Hooks, Javascript, CSS

**Key Features**:
- Add and Delete tasks
- React hooks - useState
- Input validation to prevent users from adding empty tasks or tasks that contain only whitespace.

**My role**:

- State Management: I utilised React's useState hook to manage the use state of the application, specifically to track the list of tasks and user input for new tasks.

- Features to allow users to add new tasks, and handle empty or invalid input (like just spaces). Additionally, I developed the functionality to remove tasks from the list, ensuring the app responded to user interactions smoothly.

- Enabled the app to handle user input efficiently by capturing text input through event handlers and adding tasks with a button click or by pressing "Enter".
